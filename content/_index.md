# Cosmic CLI

Cosmic CLI is a CLI interface to interact with Cosmic Cloud APIs.

It aims to simplify administration of Cosmic Cloud resources by providing single commands for actions that may require multiple API calls; it also runs commands against multiple API endpoints in parallel.

## Get started

* [Install Cosmic CLI](install/)
* [Setup Cosmic CLI](setup/)

## Command reference

* [See commands and their usage](commands/)
